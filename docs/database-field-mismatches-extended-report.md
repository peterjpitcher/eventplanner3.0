# Extended Database Field Mismatches Report - Additional Pages

**Date**: 2025-07-06  
**Scope**: Additional pages not covered in initial report

## Executive Summary

This extended report covers additional pages and components that weren't included in the initial database field mismatch analysis. Most pages are using server actions and are properly abstracted from direct database queries, reducing the risk of field mismatches.

## New Issues Found

### 1. Profile Page - Notification Preferences Fields

**File**: `/src/app/(authenticated)/profile/page.tsx`

**Issue**: References notification preference fields that may not exist
- `sms_notifications` 
- `email_notifications`

**Location in Schema**: The `profiles` table in the schema dump shows these fields DO exist, so this should work correctly.

### 2. Private Bookings SMS Templates

**File**: `/src/app/(authenticated)/private-bookings/[id]/messages/page.tsx`

**Template Variables Referenced**:
```
customer_name, event_date, event_time, guest_count, 
venue_name, setup_time, total_amount, deposit_amount,
balance_amount, booking_url, created_at
```

**Status**: These fields exist in the `private_bookings` table or can be calculated, so no issues.

### Private Bookings Pages
- **Contract** (`/private-bookings/[id]/contract/page.tsx`) - No DB queries, uses props
- **Items** (`/private-bookings/[id]/items/page.tsx`) - Uses server actions
- **Messages** (`/private-bookings/[id]/messages/page.tsx`) - Template variables verified
- **Calendar** (`/private-bookings/calendar/page.tsx`) - Uses server actions
- **SMS Queue** (`/private-bookings/sms-queue/page.tsx`) - Properly mapped

### User Management Pages
- **Users List** (`/users/page.tsx`) - Uses server actions
- **Roles** (`/roles/page.tsx`) - Uses server actions
- **Role Permissions** - Properly mapped to permissions tables

### Other Pages
- **GDPR** (`/settings/gdpr/page.tsx`) - Uses server actions
- **Calendar Test** (`/settings/calendar-test/page.tsx`) - No DB queries
- **Webhook Test** (`/settings/webhook-test/page.tsx`) - Uses server actions

## Database Tables Referenced

### Properly Mapped Tables
1. **profiles** - Notification preferences exist
2. **business_hours** - All fields mapped correctly
3. **special_hours** - All fields mapped correctly
4. **api_keys** - Proper structure with relationships
5. **webhook_logs** - All fields present
6. **audit_logs** - Comprehensive field set
7. **background_jobs** - Job queue properly structured
8. **private_booking_sms_queue** - SMS queue fields verified
9. **user_roles** - Role management tables correct
10. **permissions** - RBAC tables properly structured

## TypeScript Interfaces Defined

Several pages define detailed TypeScript interfaces that should match database schema:

### Private Booking Items
```typescript
interface BookingItem {
  id: string
  booking_id: string
  item_type: 'space' | 'catering' | 'vendor' | 'custom'
  description: string
  quantity: number
  unit_price: number
  line_total: number
  // ... etc
}
```

These interfaces are properly defined and match the database schema.

## Recommendations

### 1. No Critical Issues in Extended Review
The additional pages reviewed don't have the same critical field mismatch issues as the events table.

### 2. Server Actions Provide Good Abstraction
Most pages use server actions which helps prevent direct field reference errors.

### 3. Consider Adding Type Safety
For pages that do use direct database queries, consider using generated types from the database schema to catch mismatches at compile time.

## Conclusion

The extended review found that most additional pages in the application are well-structured and don't have database field mismatch issues. The main problems remain in the events table (as documented in the main report) and potentially in some API endpoints.

The use of server actions throughout the application provides a good abstraction layer that helps prevent many potential field mismatch errors.
