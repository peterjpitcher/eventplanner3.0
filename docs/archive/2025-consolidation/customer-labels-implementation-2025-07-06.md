# Customer Labels Implementation Summary

## Overview
A comprehensive customer labeling system has been implemented to allow retrospective labeling of customers based on their behavior and history. This system enables better customer segmentation and targeting.

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Components

1. **Database Migration** (`/supabase/migrations/20250706160000_add_customer_labels.sql`)
   - Created `customer_labels` table for label definitions
   - Created `customer_label_assignments` table for customer-label relationships
   - Added RLS policies for proper access control
   - Created function for retroactive label application
   - Included default labels (VIP, Regular, New Customer, At Risk, etc.)

2. **Server Actions** (`/src/app/actions/customer-labels.ts`)
   - `getCustomerLabels()` - Fetch all labels
   - `createCustomerLabel()` - Create new label
   - `updateCustomerLabel()` - Update existing label
   - `deleteCustomerLabel()` - Delete label
   - `getCustomerLabelAssignments()` - Get labels for a customer
   - `assignLabelToCustomer()` - Assign label to customer
   - `removeLabelFromCustomer()` - Remove label from customer
   - `bulkAssignLabel()` - Assign label to multiple customers
   - `applyLabelsRetroactively()` - Apply rules to all customers

3. **UI Components**
   - **CustomerLabelSelector** (`/src/components/CustomerLabelSelector.tsx`)
     - Displays assigned labels with color coding
     - Shows auto-assigned vs manual labels
     - Allows adding/removing labels (when editing enabled)
   
   - **Settings Page** (`/src/app/(authenticated)/settings/customer-labels/page.tsx`)
     - Full CRUD for label management
     - Color picker for label visualization
     - Apply retroactively button
     - Permission-based access control

4. **Integration**
   - Labels added to customers list page (desktop and mobile views)
   - Settings page linked from main settings menu
   - "Manage Labels" button on customers page for quick access

## Default Labels Created

1. **VIP** (Gold) - For high-value customers
2. **Regular** (Green) - Customers who attend regularly
3. **New Customer** (Blue) - Recently joined customers
4. **At Risk** (Red) - Haven't attended in 60 days
5. **Birthday Club** (Pink) - Customers in birthday program
6. **Corporate** (Purple) - Corporate/business customers
7. **Special Needs** (Blue) - Customers requiring special assistance
8. **Banned** (Red) - Customers not allowed to book

## Auto-Apply Rules

The system includes automatic labeling based on customer behavior:
- **Regular**: Attended 5+ events in last 90 days
- **New Customer**: Created within last 30 days
- **At Risk**: No attendance in 60+ days
- **VIP**: Can be manually configured based on spend/attendance

## Deployment Steps

### ⚠️ Required: Database Migration

The customer labels tables need to be created in the database before the feature can be used:

1. **Via Supabase Dashboard:**
   ```
   1. Go to Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor
   2. Open /supabase/migrations/20250706160000_add_customer_labels.sql
   3. Copy and paste the entire content
   4. Click "Run" to execute the migration
   ```

2. **Via Supabase CLI:**
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```

3. **Verify Installation:**
   ```bash
   tsx scripts/check-customer-labels.ts
   ```

### After Migration

Once the tables are created:

1. **Apply Labels Retroactively:**
   - Navigate to Settings > Customer Labels
   - Click "Apply Retroactively" button
   - This will analyze all customers and apply appropriate labels

2. **View Labels:**
   - Labels appear on the customers list page
   - Each customer shows their assigned labels with colors

3. **Manage Labels:**
   - Add custom labels via Settings > Customer Labels
   - Edit colors and descriptions
   - Set up auto-apply rules (future enhancement)

## Technical Details

### Database Schema

```sql
-- customer_labels table
id: UUID (primary key)
name: VARCHAR(255) (unique)
description: TEXT
color: VARCHAR(7) (hex color)
icon: VARCHAR(50)
auto_apply_rules: JSONB
created_at: TIMESTAMPTZ
updated_at: TIMESTAMPTZ

-- customer_label_assignments table
id: UUID (primary key)
customer_id: UUID (foreign key)
label_id: UUID (foreign key)
auto_assigned: BOOLEAN
assigned_at: TIMESTAMPTZ
assigned_by: UUID
```

### Security

- RLS policies ensure users can only manage labels based on their permissions
- Audit logging tracks all label assignments
- Permission checks in both server actions and UI

### Performance Considerations

- Indexes on foreign keys for fast lookups
- Efficient bulk operations for retroactive application
- Minimal impact on customer list loading

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Auto-Apply Rules**
   - Based on spending amount
   - Based on specific event categories
   - Time-based rules (seasonal customers)

2. **Label-Based Features**
   - Filter customers by labels
   - Bulk SMS to labeled groups
   - Export customers by label
   - Label-specific pricing/discounts

3. **Analytics**
   - Label distribution charts
   - Label trend analysis
   - Conversion tracking by label

## Testing

Test the implementation with:
```bash
# Check database status
tsx scripts/check-customer-labels.ts

# Verify UI components
npm run dev
# Navigate to /customers and /settings/customer-labels

# Run lint checks
npm run lint
```

## Notes

- Labels are visible to all users who can view customers
- Only users with 'customers:manage' permission can edit labels
- The system is designed to be extensible for future features
- All label operations are audit logged for compliance
