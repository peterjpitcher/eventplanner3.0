## Conclusion

This comprehensive list reveals the true scope of UI/UX issues in the application. While the initial audit identified surface-level problems, this deep analysis shows systemic issues requiring significant investment to fix properly.

The good news: fixing these issues will transform the application into a modern, maintainable, and user-friendly system. The bad news: it's a bigger job than initially estimated.

Recommendation: Commit to the full 16-20 week timeline with proper resources, or risk continued technical debt accumulation and user dissatisfaction.
