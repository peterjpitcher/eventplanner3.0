## Invoice Numbering Strategy

The system uses a disguised sequential numbering system:
- Internal: Sequential counter (1, 2, 3...)
- Display: `INV-[ENCODED]` where ENCODED is (sequence + 5000) converted to base-36
- Example: Invoice #1 = `INV-03QD`, Invoice #100 = `INV-03WG`
- Appears random but maintains sequential integrity for accounting

## Security & Access Control

- **Module**: 'invoices' added to RBAC system
- **Actions**: view, create, edit, delete
- **Access**: Superadmin only
- **Audit**: All operations logged with user, timestamp, and details
- **Data Protection**: Soft delete for audit trail

## API Endpoints Needed

1. `/api/invoices/[id]/pdf` - Generate PDF
2. `/api/invoices/[id]/email` - Send via Graph API
3. `/api/invoices/export` - Bulk export
4. `/api/invoices/recurring/process` - Process recurring invoices

## UI/UX Considerations

1. **Responsive Design**: All interfaces work on mobile
2. **Loading States**: Proper feedback during operations
3. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages
4. **Success Feedback**: Confirmation of actions
