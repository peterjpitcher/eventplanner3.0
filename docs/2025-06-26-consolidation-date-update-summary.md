# Documentation Consolidation Date Update Summary

**Date:** 2025-06-26
**Task:** Update consolidated documentation filenames and headers to reflect actual source file dates

## Files Renamed

All consolidated documentation files have been renamed to reflect the earliest date of their source files:

1. **2025-06-26-api-documentation.md** → **2025-06-15-api-documentation.md**
   - Earliest source: api-reference.md (2025-06-15)
   - Date range: 2025-06-15 to 2025-06-24

2. **2025-06-26-database-documentation.md** → **2025-06-15-database-documentation.md**
   - Earliest source: database-schema.md (2025-06-15)
   - Date range: 2025-06-15 to 2025-06-26

3. **2025-06-26-deployment-guide.md** → **2025-06-15-deployment-guide.md**
   - Earliest source: deployment.md (2025-06-15)
   - Date range: 2025-06-15 to 2025-06-22

4. **2025-06-26-developer-guide.md** → **2025-06-15-developer-guide.md**
   - Earliest source: development.md (2025-06-15)
   - Date range: 2025-06-15 to 2025-06-21

5. **2025-06-26-fixes-tracker.md** → **2025-06-25-fixes-tracker.md**
   - Earliest source: fixes-required-overview.md (2025-06-25)
   - Date range: 2025-06-25 to 2025-06-26

## Header Updates

Each file's "Generated on" header has been updated to show:
- The earliest source file date
- The date range of all consolidated source files

Example:
```
**Generated on:** 2025-06-15 (consolidated from source files dated 2025-06-15 to 2025-06-24)
```

## Rationale

This change provides better clarity about when the original documentation was created, rather than when it was consolidated. This helps maintain a more accurate documentation history and makes it easier to track when specific documentation sections were originally written.
