# The Anchor VIPs - Future State Program Design

## Vision Statement

The Anchor VIPs will be the UK's most engaging pub loyalty program, combining the simplicity of SMS-based membership with modern gamification elements that create a vibrant community of event enthusiasts. By 2025, we'll have 500+ active members driving 40% of all event bookings through a program that feels more like a fun game than a traditional loyalty scheme.
