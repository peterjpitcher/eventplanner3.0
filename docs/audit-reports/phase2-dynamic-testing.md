- `/api/webhooks/twilio` - SMS status callbacks
- `/api/private-bookings/contract` - Contract generation

### Server Actions (26 identified)
- Well-structured using Next.js server actions

- Consistent return format

## 5. Security Testing Results

### Positive Findings

- ✅ CSRF protection built into Next.js
- ✅ Authentication required for all protected routes
- ✅ Row Level Security enabled on tables

### Areas of Concern
1. **Input Validation**
   - Missing client-side validation on many forms
   - Server-side validation inconsistent

2. **Business Logic**
   - No capacity enforcement on bookings
   - Time format validation missing
   - Past event dates allowed

## Issues Summary

### Critical Priority
None

### High Priority
1. **Missing Booking Capacity Validation**
   - **Component:** Bookings
   - **Issue:** Can book more seats than event capacity
   - **Impact:** Overbooking possible
   - **Suggested Fix:** Add database constraint or application validation

2. **Missing Time Format Validation**
   - **Component:** Private Bookings
   - **Issue:** Invalid times like "25:00" accepted
   - **Impact:** Data integrity issues
   - **Suggested Fix:** Add time format validation

### Medium Priority
1. **Incomplete Form Validation**
   - **Component:** Multiple forms
   - **Issue:** Missing required fields, format validation
   - **Impact:** Poor UX, potential bad data
   - **Suggested Fix:** Add Zod validation schemas

2. **Past Event Dates Allowed**
   - **Component:** Events
   - **Issue:** Can create events in the past
   - **Impact:** Confusion, unnecessary data
   - **Suggested Fix:** Add date validation

### Low Priority
1. **Form Field Naming**
   - **Component:** Private booking forms
   - **Issue:** Generic CSS classes used as field names
   - **Impact:** Harder to maintain
   - **Suggested Fix:** Use proper name attributes
